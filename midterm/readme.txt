Title: Allegra's Corner

The intention of this project is to make hand-made artwork accessible and interactive on a digital platform.
I made each collage (the town, the circus tent's interior, and the diner's interior) by hand, then I scanned them into the computer.

The user should be able to interact with the map on a basic level, meaning they can enter the two buildings and return back to the map when they are done.
Inside the buildings, the user can hear music playing which they can stop by simply clicking the mouse.

I like the direction in which this idea is heading, and I think I might be interested in expanding it beyond this assignment on my own time.
