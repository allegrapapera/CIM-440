#Interactive Movie: Battle of the Pizza Shop Goths

This project is an interactive video project. The videos paired with the button features allow for the user to choose their preferred progression through the story.
I filmed these clips, and my friends acted in them.

I created this project to explore the ways in which p5.js can be used to interact with and potentially enhance video content.
I find that one of the best qualities about learning to program is the way it makes me feel like I have the tools to create anything I want to.
Similarly, when it comes to storytelling/making videos, having a smartphone camera and a few ideas is enough to create something.
Clearly, the content in this project is playful, and I think that just further exemplifies the way that there is very little barrier to entry when it comes to creating things with the intention of feeling joy and without taking oneself too seriously.
Being able to combine programming with different creative outlets only elevates the experience for creators and consumers, and I find that really exciting.
